mvn-junit-param :

This project explains how JUNIT tests can be run for a variety of inputs, aka parametrised tests. The example written uses DataProvider through its methods.
A flavour of the DataProvider method is written to show how inputs can be provied through XML file.

The XML file input is used in cases where the user of the tests need not (know to) change the code, just the XML file input can be changed to test a variety of inputs usign teh same test method.
